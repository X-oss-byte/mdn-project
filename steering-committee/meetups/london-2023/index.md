# MDN Get-Together (Mozilla and Open Web Docs)

Date: Jan 18-20, 2023

Location: Google UK, 6 Pancras Sq, London

## Whatâ€™s happening

Mozilla and Open Web Docs will meet in-person in London to discuss a joint roadmap for content on MDN, find common ways to improve MDN and formalize the working relationship around things we plan together, and things that the respective orgs will work on separately.

## The goal

To improve our working relationships and communication, and to create a unified working process for both teams. This would involve discussions on current individual team processes, any pain points and workshopping towards collective approaches for the future. In addition, discussing each team's roadmaps and goals/projects for 2023 to better support each other with common resources.

## The outcome

A more productive way of working and communicating together. A better understanding for both teams on upcoming collaborative work, including prioritization of projects and management of resources.

* A shared joint roadmap for 2023 and project list for Q1 2023
* Clear guidelines and process for adding to or revising the roadmap
* One shared location that outlines the collaboration between MDN and OWD, processes, content planning meetings etc.

## MDN 2023 content goals

* [MDN GitHub Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/projects/26/views/7)
* Ensure documentation is kept current
* Run experiments with documenting the wider web tooling ecosystem (new content)
* Run experiments to identify new ways for MDN users to interact with code
* Enhance discoverability within MDN: Improve sidebars, visually differentiate between page types
