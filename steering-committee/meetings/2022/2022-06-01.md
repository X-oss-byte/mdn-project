## Notes

**Will:** published blogpost about WTD, filed tracking issues to track removal of var. 600 pages use var. All in a spreadsheet. Has been bumpy with the contributors. Continuing to work on Web/API page types, updated 3000 pages. JYP has done detailed reviews. Open issues - Web GL extensions in terms of page types

**Dominic:** Web GL extensions are not going away. Why can't they have their own page type?

**Will:** Web GL extensions are unlike the other things we have. So maybe we can have them as separate page types. Just a cognitive load of 100s of page types. It should be okay to have their own page type though.

**Dominic:** Do HTTP have their own page types?

**Lola:** Ada will be taking over from me. Going to start coding the website. Ada was involved with WebXR stuff when Chris Mills was around.

**Dominic:** any feedback about diagrams about the CSS syntax? Railroad diagrams for syntax

**Will:** Interesting idea but would take investment/justification. Previous user research shows not many people use formal syntax, but chicken and egg - it's badly presented so people don't use it. But it is potentially very useful. css-tree might provide good tools for more interactive exploration of formal syntax.
