## Agenda

- GC update 
    - Events sponsorship
- Staff update 
    - (Estelle) 
        - Github: caught up on a lot of PRs, issues, etc.
        - Cascade tutorial is progressing.
    - (Jean-Yves)
        - [Discussion](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions/140) about Polyfills on MDN:
            - Consensus about using a YAML key in each page
            - Next step will likely be to propose a list of sites we accept polyfills to (or should).
        - Updating our JS snippet: [discussion ](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/143)in progress	
            - Please, feedback welcome
        - Removing the last bits of DOMHighResTimestamp and DOMTimestamp -> once gone we have a _page type_ on 100% of API pages
        - Still reviewing a lot of PRs (431 in June)
    - (Will)
        - CSSSyntax macro landed! [https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/4656](https://github.com/mdn/yari/pull/4656) and it looks good. Thanks everyone who helped. There is some follow-up, e.g. [https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions/138](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions/138) . I will write a blog about this (when I get back from vacay).
        - CSSInfo and webref: Patrick Brosset did some very interesting analysis: [https://github.com/mdn/data/issues/585](https://github.com/mdn/data/issues/585) which we should pick up when we come to this. Also probably some feedback to the specs.
        - Q2 draft report: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8P9NNKe7WVr3cbfyWbcnGVgCI69JLvdxtgNQtnXBNY/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A8P9NNKe7WVr3cbfyWbcnGVgCI69JLvdxtgNQtnXBNY/edit#) 
        - Would still happily accept input on JS page types: [https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/16156](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/16156)  
        - Right now we have fewer open issues than we had at the start of the year!!! I will make a celebratory graph today.
        - On vacation from Friday->second week in August
    - (Vinyl) - Skipping due to limited time
        - Working hard on BCD
        - PRs for GlobalEventHandlers for BCD have all been filled, only contentâ€™s left
        - On vacation from yesterday to next Tuesday
- Others
    - (Offline update by Lola): Main update is that Vladimir has sent a revised logo which Estelle & Vinyl have a copy of & I hope to be done w/ the site within the next week.
    - Robert: MDN traffic data discussion

## Notes:

* GC update:
    * Event sponsorship: (Robert): we have budget for a meeting that we might be able to use this year for sponsorship, but next year we might be able to have a budget specifically for event sponsorship. (Dominic) GC needs to see specific proposals and evaluate case by case, to decide whether we can sponsor. Who will be there, what is the benefit. Why this, why now. Where do we need expert input?
* Estelle:
    * Hopes to have cascade tutorial done this week or next
* Jean-Yves:
    * Polyfills: Robert: Google has had discussion about measuring the quality of polyfills. Rachel: have a spec for judging whether a polyfill should be recommended. Some polyfills esp in CSS have side effects. Will: initially look at fixing our problems, esp in JS, and next look at adding good polyfills in general, as a site feature. So potentially 2 (or more) steps.
    * JS code sample modernization: (Jean-Yves): what should we change in our examples?
* Robert: MDN traffic data. Having discussed the numbers with Mozilla engineering this week, there are lots of caveats with the data that we have, so we should not use it to drive decisions at this point.
