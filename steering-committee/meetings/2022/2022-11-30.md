## Notes

* Meeting date is set
* Performance API documentation work: all have sensible examples now instead of just testing support. Use cases that might be useful are more helpful. Navigation timing is up next. Will has started work on performance API. A link to the draft PR will be posted here.
* BCD: No real updates. BCD is progressing well. New PRs and collector script running again. PRs are being reviewed at a decent pace.
* Inert: dialog and inert are moving forward. Unclear how to add inert to dialog since the attribute is not actually used: it’s auto.
* Containment: contain property has better examples. That part is done.
* Page types: JY and Will are out. Question is can we just start with the page title work since Will has summarized it well, so maybe we can start. Moz is currently working on the road map, so priority isn’t the page types yet.
* Definitions of experimental and deprecated are aligned between MDN and BCD.
* BCD: Onkar is automating a check of synchronization between BCD and content on things like deprecated.
* Email was sent out re: flights for london.
