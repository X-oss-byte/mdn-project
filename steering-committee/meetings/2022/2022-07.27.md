Global event handlers, not on MDN, BCD, or anywhere.

Site is ready. Does GC decide when we can launch. Please forward issues found to Lola. Torgo has DNS info. Some feedback has been received. Will be incorporating it. Will be adding code to OWD github in a new repo within OWD.

We have an open source account with Netlify.

Missing events should be a different project than the current one. Celebrate wins.
