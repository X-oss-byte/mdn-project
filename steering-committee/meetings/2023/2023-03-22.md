## Notes

- Will - JYP is working on adding pages for features supported in 3 browsers based on tool created by Dominic. It is going pretty well. He’ll then move on to things supported in 2 browsers. He might take up interop 2023, constraint validation does not have good docs
- Estelle - CSS module landing pages - css color adjustments landed, brightness filter landed
- Vinyl - florian opened an issue to track our progress better. Probably we’ll work in Q2 on this. To improve change logs. To report what's new in web browsers/BCD
- Will - This will help us to track accuracy of data going forward hopefully
- Vinyl - Some features cannot be tested currently in the collector but we’re getting there
- Will - performance API docs - remaining is guide pages. A lot of work has been done since last week. Florian has been working on this. 
- Will - PWA - patrick, estelle, me have been working on. Patrick working on how-to guides.
- Estelle - wrote about install and uninstalling because the current information on MDN was not relevant. So tutorials can link to uninstall instructions. Written intro to the intro tutorial. Working on manifest explanation now.
- Will - Patrick wrote about storage limits and eviction criteria. It is browser and platform specific. Lots of feedback from firefox and chrome folks.
- Estelle - what’s next for page types? Will - not a lot left. Learn pages need to have page types. MathML is remaining. I’ve been looking at PWA. Page type status is at [https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/91#issuecomment-1460925729](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/issues/91#issuecomment-1460925729) .
- Will: Too many open issues right now, getting close to 700. Would be nice to have a process so that we don’t have to do it over a dedicated week
- Vinyl - requesting help for bcd reviews. Lot of PRs open based on the collector tool, which will now be moving to MDN.
