## Notes

- Estelle: PRs in pwa examples are waiting for review. Will will take a look. PWA tutorial intro level is up in draft form. 4 pages available to see but not ready for review
- Florian: lots of holidays in germany. So no perf update. Hope to give Will an update before going on holiday. Working with vinyl on removing obsolete html elements based on removal guidelines. Removed blink. Bring down where collector and bcd disagree. Down to 195 disagreements. Vinyl is also working on real values in html and compat in SVG.
- vinyl : posted graph of still open issues in slack. Over 80% for both. Pretty sure we can complete it by EOQ. HTTP is going to be more challenging to complete.
- Bocoup is starting work on bcd and has submitted their first PR; a description of scheme for reporting structure of JSON file of collector based on phillips version, not the up to date/currently being used version.
- (will) proposal for side bars not done yet
- May is the best month for holidays if you live in a decent country.
- Schedule changes: we are going to try and create a 3 week schedule with 3 different times zones. That way we can actually meet Hamish, the first generation MDN AI. Will be discussed on Slack and should start next week or the week after.
- Will: quasi standard is only supported in chromium which seems to be different from the standard. Removed the spec link and the “standard” documentation, as chromium is the only implementation and it is completely different than the standard track docs state, listing as non-standard. Reality and docs have diverged.
- Florian: we are not responsible for making calls as to whether something is standard. Tricky case.
- Will: Contain style webkit bug. Does it apply to quotes?
- Ruth: Brian was confused as well. Not 100% confident about the example, which may be confusing.
- Will: didn’t find a chromium bug
- Ruth: it’s in interop, so chrome should be thinking about it.
- Will: there are tests failing but passing in FF. It would be good if there was a bug to confirm. Maybe we should file it. Counter works but not quotes. Pinged Rachel about this. Will keep BCD updated.
- MDN: code editor written by Florian D. is on staging. [https://developer.allizom.org/en-US/play](https://developer.allizom.org/en-US/play)
