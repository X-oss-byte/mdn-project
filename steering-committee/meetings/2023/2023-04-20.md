## Notes

- Jean-Yves project. He’s looking at pages that are missing on MDN  that have browser support. Dominique Hazaël-Massieux created the spreadsheet with missing pages. Most are complete, with the remaining ones taking a bit more time as they are a bit more complicated
- Estelle is doing CSS module landing pages. Lot of side projects have come up. Filter effects guide collated all the information that was beyond property page content.
- Vinyl - just released v9 of bcd collector - adds new custom tests. Will help with writing future custom tests. Helps in maintaining bcd. It’ll automate a lot of stuff for us.
- Performance API project - no news, a PR needs to be reviewed
- Xidorn - can we add effects of filter effects on performance?
  - Estelle - do you want to open an issue? This would also need to be covered on filter-effects pages. It will help if you know of specific issues or situations.
  - Xidorn - Will ask performance team and get back on this
- PWA - Patrick out on vacation. PR has been approved but waiting on one question. Estelle is writing the intro tutorial. Would be good to get high-level feedback
- Page types - Will is out this week
- Page titles - project is complete
