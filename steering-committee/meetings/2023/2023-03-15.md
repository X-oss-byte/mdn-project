## Notes

- (Jean-Yves) Good progress on 3-engine project (20 new pages merged or in review)
- (Estelle) Created a color picker (PR in), lots of subpages created, for the modules project. Currently working on colors module. Created hue and will be creating other data type pages. PR for brightness needs a review.
- (Vinyl) BCD meeting moved to European morning/US evening to try to foster participation + alternate between timezone.
- (Vinyl) Moving collector to MDN: transferring ownership. 2 repositories will be set up hopefully by the end of the month. This should remove confusion around ownership.
- (Vinyl) Run on another set of data; help with review please! Check mdn_url/spec_url, check content too.
- (Florian) Will merged the last reference page. Work on guide pages. Met with Will, to use the Divio doc system (guide, how-to, …)
- (Patrick) Work is progressing nicely:
  - Will on guides (Offline PWA)
  - Patrick on smaller How-to pages (customizing colors)
  - For the moment, not really visible as there is no sidebar, but this won't last for long, waiting to have several articles.
  - Estelle: intro-level tutorial. Not yet visible, WIP.
  - Fun to work as a team!!!! Yeah!

Discussions:

- Vars: shouldn't have some left. If there is any doubt, ping Josh.
- Scroll-timiline: thank you Estelle for the review! (From Dipika)
