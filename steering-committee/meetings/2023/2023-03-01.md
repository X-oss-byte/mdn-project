    - Small and huge PRs
    - PR reviews
    - “Native” - We’ll keep using this term in the PWA docs, and change it if something comes up. Some alternatives in case this happens:
        - Platform-native
        - Platform specific
        - Device specific
        - Operating system specific
        - Compiled app
    - BCD: Ranged values - allow [pre-2020 ranges](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/19013), or [any range](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/19014)?
    - PWA project (discussion at end of meeting)

## Notes

- (Vinyl) BCD owners decision: allow pre-2020 ranged values, or any range? “We know that this was at least in v79, but could have been earlier” - ranges are usually associated with major turning points in browsers (e.g. edge->chromium). Want to add in more range values, for first versions of 2020+ releases. But long term might be better to make any version potentially a range. Can then convert all true values to ranges, and get a little more consistency. Only changing true to a range. (Florian): How many range values will be added, under this plan? Risk is that in future people will use ranges instead of precise versioning, and will reduce overall precision. Currently we allow very few ranged versions (~10). (Vinyl) think of ranges as transitional (like `true`). Florian: could consider only allowing for pre-2020, to prevent it being used for new versions. Vinyl: for many old browser versions it’s very hard to test. Florian: pre-2020 could get consensus, allowing them for all is harder.
- (Patrick) How to deliver:
  - Land pieces as we go and update landing page and nav at the end, or have a branch?
  - Ruth: similar problem with contributor docs. Rewrote everything in a different place (outside mdn/content) and then moved it. Treated it just as markdown, not MDN pages. Vinyl: could fork mdn/content. Jean-Yves: simpler to create a branch and work in there. Patrick: create a branch in the main mdn/content repo.
- (Vinyl): please help review BCD PRs. Patrick: who does reviews and how can we help? Anyone who can research PRs to verify version numbers can help. Patrick can help verify number for Edge and Chromium.
- (Will) discussed with Claas last week about having sidebars specified in JSON, not KS.
- (Estelle): should we include SVG info in filter pages, and if so how much? Jean-Yves and Dipika felt that there was too much. Ruth: the problem is SVG docs. We don’t want to lose the information. [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/24934](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/24934)
- (Estelle): spent all last week reviewing PRs. How can we allocate PR reviews?
- (Estelle): we have lots of small PRs. Can we encourage people to merge PRs? Brian: is this typo fixes? Yes. Patrick: hard to change the way contributors work here. Could investigate automation? Leave a comment like /merge and it gets done. (Vinyl): automation can lead to accidental merges. (Brian) can also approve and let someone else merge.
- (Will) “should we not use “native” and if so what? Patrick: tried using other terms but it gets difficult. Can ask within MS. Estelle: “native” does not seem problematic. “Device-specific” is less good than “OS-specific” since “device-specific” might mean just this one device. Brian: “platform-specific”? Conclusion: use “native” for now and consider changing if it comes up.
