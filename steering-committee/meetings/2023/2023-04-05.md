4. Discussions
    - New release of mdn/data?
    - Dipika - formal syntax - how to find which one is from webref. Do we always need to update mdn/data?
        - (Jean-Yves) If not hardcoded, it is from webref.
        - (Jean-Yves) mdn/data syntax is used by 3rd parties (VSCode and CSSTree)
    - Dipika - Syntax(CSS function pages) in some places contains usage examples and in some places (fewer) contains the syntax 

## Notes

- BCD 2020+
  - JS is already done
  - Florian: does the collector find new JS features? Vinyl: not yet, no: features are listed manually. If there were a webref-type thing that scraped the specs we could do this.
  - CSS next? Florian: we could, yes. CSS is hard. Vinyl: alternative is Web APIs, which is the biggest category but has had more attention than CSS recently.
- Interop:
  - Q1 project is done!
  - Jean-Yves: will pause this project for a couple of weeks, probably to work on page types, as a kind of holiday.
  - During the project some features became supported by 3 engines, and they also got documented.
- Performance guides
  - In review.
  - This project might not write all possible how-to and tutorials yet.
- PWA docs:
  - We are happy to be able to make new content discoverable
- Page types
  - Jean-Yves might pick this up next week 
- Page retitling
  - Will might get this started next week: convert a sample of the Web/API docs so we can see it in the wild.
- Prettier
  - A couple of issues (HTML and add-ons) but mostly done. 
- mdn/data:
  - On MDN, still used for formal definition, not for formal syntax
  - But others still use formal syntax from mdn/data (e.g. VSCode)
  - Also, nonstandard properties are not in webref.
  - Could use webref for formal definition as well? Tricky because not everything in formal definition exists there: need to decide what we want to show for formal def.
  - Could move other clients away from mdn/data, help them migrate to webref.
- Dipika: no standard for syntax in CSS functions: we should have a template for this page type.
