## Notes

- Patrick: discussion on how to “complete” the project that we can call it and announce it as done. More needs to be done, but at which point can it be announced.
- Need to review content based on Apple/Safari’s announcements.
- Jen: need to revisit the definition of PWA, as it’s not standard. Is e.g. service worker required? Being about _web apps_, and putting users first, not focusing immediately on specific platform requirements. Call it web apps instead of progressive web apps?
- Consider that the definition of web apps is a user experience, not a set of technical requirements. Different platforms may have different technical requirements to enable that user experience (e.g. manifest, service worker) but these requirements are not definitive.
