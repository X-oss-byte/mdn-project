## Notes

- BCD completed accuracy project: 100% accuracy going back to 2020!
- PWA project will complete this week, some loose ends to tie up.
- CSS module pages: not all pages are ready for review yet. Prettier errors. Disable Prettier CI check? [https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/27070](https://github.com/mdn/content/pull/27070) Web editor does not apply Prettier, and this is bad for casual contributors. Estelle is going through the list of modules to figure out which are left for H2.
- Page types: Jean-Yves is finishing this project. Learning Area is the main one missing. PRs for many other areas. PWA - consider how-to/tutorial/guide?
- Brian: MDN traffic: dip in 10% since April 1, similar to other sites. Why?
