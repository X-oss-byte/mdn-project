## Notes

- JY: a few pages were written this week. Not much was accomplished
- Estelle: color picker tool is old. Updating color picker tool.
- BCD: more updates in the call.
- Perf layout shift PR review will be by Will
- PWAs: Patrick has merge rights.
- BCD/compat in guides. Would be great to be able to build a table containing a customized list of items (e.g. as arguments to the macro). Estelle: BCD does not describe operating systems. Could add this for PWA as hardcoded tables and then add it into BCD proper. Florian: BCD is 2 sides: data collection and rendering. OS support is not just an issue in PWAs, but also e.g. WebGL and media formats. Continue discussion after this meeting.
- Page types: Jean-Yves will help.
- Sidebars (Jean-Yves): QuickLinksWithSubpages - remove it? Yes.
- Estelle, TIL: Browser devtools will let you simulate color blindness.
