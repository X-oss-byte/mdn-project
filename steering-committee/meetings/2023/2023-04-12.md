## Notes

- Estelle: Filter effects page landing soon
- Vinyl: BCD: RTC stats report. That interface is time consuming. Not easy to test for support.
- Florian: BCD for WebGPU: it's in Firefox nightly.
- Ruth: saw it. Thanks for reviewing.
- Florian: Perf API PR landed. New docs on many timings. First new guide is server timing. Perf docs try to apply Divio doc system rules.
- Will: PWA Docs: Will new side bar is deployed. Landed last week. Deployed now.
- Estelle: wrote an PWA period tracker app. Much easier to document an existing app. Draft available
- JY: Will landed page types for HTTP. It was blocked by a JY PR. JY did PR for MathML. Working on a11y page types.
- Noticed that there are pages with just 1 paragraph, and if you put several together, there is the original document. Not sure what happened.
- Will: For a11y, please use the same format we just created. Working with the new.
- We filed 24 new page title PRs. THanks JY for reviewing boring PRs. It was convenient to find 20 flaws that were easy to fix. The remaining ones are the challenging ones. So far no one has complained about the new titles. Jake sent a tweet: he’s happy.
- We should have same name static and instance members. We can’t document JSON members today.
- Will: we need to have different slugs if we want to support same name. It’s in the discussion. Easiest to have a suffix; so that’s what we should do. It’s hacky but easy. Filed a PR to make the change; but the PR is rotted. Yarn content move?  Will DOMXref break? If you think so, advise please. YCM replaces double quotes with single, and prettier does the inverse. Onkar has a PR to fix this. Is add-redirect broken? There’s issues we can’t fix. Will will file a bug. Ruth: yes, it’s broken. JY it works, but move has issues.
- Ruth: We’re moving from AWS to CGP, so Claas is super busy.
