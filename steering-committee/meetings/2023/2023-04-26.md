## Notes

- (Jean-Yves) updates to constraint validation is about 30 pages.
- (Estelle) can enumerated types fit under data types? Jean-Yves: won’t work with CSSInfo or CSSSyntax, because not in the specs.
- (Jean-Yves) redirects will enable domxref to work with `_static` suffixes. Onkar’s linting PR will pick up and fix Yari breakages.
- (Vinyl) translated-content teams are running Prettier in other locales.
- (Will) Will will start a discussion about Onkar’s PR to collect general feedback. Also would like another code reviewer for it.
- (Estelle) enumerated data types:
  - Can they have BCD? (Florian) they are weird for BCD because not possible to describe “support” for them. But this is also true of real data types.
  - They also can’t have formal syntax, so formal syntax would have to become optional for types.
  - (Estelle) line-type will also be a case of this. Make a PR for that and see how it looks?
